//! Implements data flow control for connections to remote actor groups.
//!
//! The basic idea is that we want to adjust the amount of traffic local actor
//! sends to a remote actor according to it's processing rate. This is important
//! for two reasons:
//!  1. Avoid overwhelming slow remote actor with lots of messages from a fast
//!     local actor
//!  2. Avoid network congestion
//!
//! This is implemented through maintaining two "windows": one for the sender
//! and another one for the receiver. Window is an estimate of how many messages
//! the receiver can handle during some period of time, implemented as a
//! semaphore. Before sending a message, sender acquires budget from the window.
//! When the receiver acknowledges that a message was processed, budget is
//! returned to the window.
//!
//! Finally, there are two ways the sender can send a message: bounded and
//! unbounded. Bounded send waits until there is enough budget in the sender's
//! window before sending the message. Unbounded send always gets the budget
//! immediately, even if there is zero available. This can lead to window size
//! being a negative number.
//!
//! See `TxFlowControl` and `RxFlowControl` for implementations of sender's and
//! receiver's windows respectively.
//!
//! If none of this makes sense, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_control_(data) and
//! https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sliding_window_protocol for a more elaborate explanation.

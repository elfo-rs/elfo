//! Provides a cooperative budget for actors.
//!
//! # The Problem
//!
//! A single call to an actor's `poll` may potentially do a lot of work before
//! it returns `Poll::Pending`. If an actor runs for a long period of time
//! without yielding back to the executor, it can starve other actors waiting on
//! that executor to execute them, or drive underlying resources. Since Rust
//! does not have a runtime, it is difficult to forcibly preempt a long-running
//! task. Instead, this module provides an opt-in mechanism for actors to
//! collaborate with the executor to avoid starvation.
//!
//! This approach is similar to the one used in tokio.
//!
//! # Supported budgets
//!
//! Elfo supports two kinds of budgeting for actors:
//! * by time: the actor yields to the executor after a certain amount of time,
//!   5ms by default.
//! * by count: the actor yields to the executor after a certain number of
//!   [`consume_budget()`] calls, 64 by default.
//!
//! A used kind is determined by the presence of telemetry. It's a controversial
//! decision, but the reason is that telemetry requires fast time source
//! (usually, TSC), which is provided by the `quanta` crate. In this case, time
//! measurements are negligible and a time-based budget is preferred as a more
//! reliable way to prevent starvation.
//!
//! Note that methods [`Context::recv()`] and [`Context::try_recv()`] call
//! [`consume_budget()`] already, so you don't need to think about budgeting
//! in most cases.
//!
//! These limits cannot be configured for now.
//!
//! # Coordination with tokio's budget system
//!
//! Tokio has its own budget system, which is unstable and cannot be used by
//! elfo. Thus, elfo's budget system is independent of tokio's and work
//! simultaneously.
//!
//! However, since both budgets are reset at start of each actor's poll, no
//! matter which budget is exhausted first, both system work coordinately.
//!
//! [`Context::recv()`]: crate::context::Context::recv
//! [`Context::try_recv()`]: crate::context::Context::try_recv
